## Files :
This code consists of these Python files:

`LSTM.ipynb` - contains LSTM model

`ARIMA.ipynb` - contains ARIMA model

`Hidden_Markov_Model.ipynb` - contains the HMM model

## Dependencies :
Keras,
Tensorflow,
Statsmodel,
Numpy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Sklearn,
hmmlearn.


## Running :
### On Personal Computer with Jupyter Notebook / VS Code:
1. To run the program, open the files `LSTM.ipynb`, `ARIMA.ipynb`, `Hidden_Markov_Model.ipynb` and run the cells in order.


The LSTM model was trained and the produced weights are saved to the directory. The user can simply use these weights to directly predict the future prices.
